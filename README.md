# MUBI MOVIE & TV SHOWES ANALYSIS (Using PowerBI)📊📈
## Introduction: -

🙋‍♀️I'm excited to share that I recently created a dashboard using Power BI that showcases some interesting insights from a dataset that I found on Kaggle.

📊The dataset I used is called the "Mubi SQLite Database for Movie Lovers" and it contains five separate CSV files with over 85,000 rows of data in each file.

💡When I started working with the dataset, I knew that I had to do some cleaning and preprocessing in order to make the data more manageable.

💡To do this, I created a Python script that cleaned and transformed the data. The script also merged a few columns using left join to make the data more organized.

💡Once the data was clean, I used Power BI to create a dashboard that displayed the insights I found. I created measures using functions like SUMX, FILTER, CALCULATE, COUNT, DISTINCT COUNT, COUNTROWS, and more to help me find meaningful insights.

💡I also created relationships between different tables to combine data from multiple sources.

💡The final product was a dashboard that showcased the insights I found in the data. I attached a screenshot of the visualization to my LinkedIn post, and I'm excited to share my work with my network.
